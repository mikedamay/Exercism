/*
Exercises in exercism are designed to be run by unit tests. Pay close attention to the instructions 
about running the tests, and follow the link there to the C# language page if you're running into trouble. 
Your submission is expected to return a value rather than outputting it to the console. 
Your initial download should have included a Leap.cs file with a template for you to get started with. 
Once you've got that figured out, go ahead and submit a new solution. :-)
